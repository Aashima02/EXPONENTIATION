# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## EQUIPMENT'S REQUIRED:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## ALGORITHM:
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## PROGRAM:
```

def expo(x):
    for i in range(1):
        x = x ** 2
    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",x)
x = int(input())
expo(x)
```

## OUTPUT:
![exponentiation](./output.png)



## RESULT:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
